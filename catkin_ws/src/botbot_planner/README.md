# MMS Template

### What is this?

The minimum boilerplate required to have a functional ROS package. Delete what you don't need.

You should also symlink the .clang-format and .clang-tidy files from **mms_library** into the projet root:

```{bash}
ln -s ~/catkin_ws/src/mms_master/mms_library/.clang-format .

ln -s ~/catkin_ws/src/mms_master/mms_library/.clang-tidy .
```
